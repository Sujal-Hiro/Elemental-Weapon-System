# Halloween-Themed Elemental Weapon System Game ðŸŽƒðŸ”«

## ðŸš€ Game Mechanics

The main objective is to utilize the modular weapon system effectively. Each weapon has distinct effects and can be activated/deactivated.


## ðŸ“² Features

- **Elemental Weapons**: Switch between three unique weaponsâ€”Fire, Ice, and Electricity.
- **Halloween Theme**: Engaging Halloween-inspired aesthetics and environments.
- **Optimized for Mobile**: Designed with Android compatibility in mind.
- **Dynamic Visual Effects**: Each weapon effect is created with Unityâ€™s Shader Graph and VFX Graph.


## ðŸ§© Project Structure

### **Scripts Demonstrating OOP Principles**

The weapon system is built using an abstract base class `Weapon` and specific child classes for each elemental weapon (Fire, Ice, Electric). This structure demonstrates how OOP can be extensible and modular.

#### Weapon Base Class

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public abstract class Weapon : MonoBehaviour
{
    public abstract void Activate();
    public abstract void Deactivate();
    public abstract void ApplyEffect();
}
```
### **Shader Graph and VFX Graph Setups**

Each weapon uses unique visual effects created using Shader Graph and VFX Graph. Below is a brief description of each setup:

#### Fire Effect ðŸ”¥

The fire weapon effect includes a vibrant, animated fire texture combined with particle-based flames to create a dynamic and fiery look.
